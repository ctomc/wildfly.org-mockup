The upcoming WildFly 11 release includes support for OpenSSL. This provides two main advantages over JSSE:

- Support for ALPN on all JDK's
- Significantly improved performance compared to JSSE

== Setting up OpenSSL

In general for Linux based systems all that is required is to install a recent version of OpenSSL using your systems
package manager. The OpenSSL support will search the library path, and use whatever version of OpenSSL it finds. The
same applies to MacOS when OpenSSL has been installed using brew (the system default OpenSSL installation is too old).

For windows and for custom OpenSSL locations you need to specify the location via a system property,
`org.wildfly.openssl.path`. If this is set then Wildfly will search for OpenSSL in the directory specified. If you have
multiple versions of OpenSSL in the same directory and need to specify the precise file to use you can instead use
`org.wildfly.openssl.path.ssl` and `org.wildfly.openssl.path.crypto` to specify the path to libssl and libcrypto
respectively.

As Wildfly uses dynamic linking this should work with any OpenSSL version from 1.0.1 onwards (however for security
reasons it is recommended to always use the most up to date 1.1.x or 1.0.x version that is available, as older versions
may have unpatched vulnerabilities).


== Setting up Wildfly with Security Realms

As Wildfly supports SSL out of the box with dynamically generated self signed certificates all that is required is to
change the protocol in use. Doing this is as simple as running a single command in the CLI:

----
/core-service=management/security-realm=ApplicationRealm/server-identity=ssl:write-attribute(name=protocol, value=openssl.TLS)
----

Other valid values are `openssl.TLSv1.1` and `openssl.TLSv1.2`, which limit the minimum TLS version to 1.1 and 1.2
respectively.

Once this is done you can use OpenSSL by simply pointing your browser to https://localhost:8443[https://localhost:8443].
You should see the following message in the log that tells you that OpenSSL is in use:

----
09:01:04,150 INFO  [org.wildfly.openssl.SSL] (MSC service thread 1-6) WFOPENSSL0002 OpenSSL Version OpenSSL 1.0.2l  25 May 2017
----

== Setting up Wildfly with Elytron

As Elytron is not used by default there is a little bit more work involved in setting it up. Elytron does not support
auto generation of SSL certificates, so for the sake of this example I am going to assume that the keystore is
located at `standalone/configuration/application.keystore` (the same location that the auto generated keystore is placed,
if you just want a self signed certificate for testing purposes you can simply connect to
https://localhost:8443[https://localhost:8443] with the default configuration and one will be generated for you).

In order to set up SSL using Elytron run the following commands (note that this is just to use JSSE, the OpenSSL config
will come later).

----
/subsystem=elytron/key-store=server:add(path=application.keystore, relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir, credential-reference={clear-text=password}, type=jks)
/subsystem=elytron/key-manager=server:add(key-store=server, credential-reference={clear-text=password}, algorithm=SunX509)
/subsystem=elytron/server-ssl-context=server:add(key-manager=server, protocols=[TLSv1.2])
batch
/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=https:undefine-attribute(name=security-realm)
/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=https:write-attribute(name=ssl-context, value=server)
run-batch
:reload
----

If you point your browser at https://localhost:8443[https://localhost:8443] you should now have a working Elytron based
SSL config. Once you have verified that this has worked we now need to change it to use OpenSSL. To do this we change
the ordering of the providers in the elytron combined-providers, which means that OpenSSL will now take precedence:

----
/subsystem=elytron/aggregate-providers=combined-providers:list-add(index=0, name=providers, value=openssl)
/subsystem=elytron/aggregate-providers=combined-providers:list-remove(index=2, name=providers)
----

You should now have OpenSSL working with Elytron.
