[cols="a,a"]

==== Fast Startup

Experience ground breaking startup speed!

In the highly optimized boot process of WildFly 8, services are started
concurrently to eliminate unnecessary waits and to tap into the power of
multi-core processors. Non-critical services are kept on ice until first
use.

As a result, WildFly offers a 10-fold reduction in startup time over
previous versions and even gives Jetty and Tomcat a run for their money.

==== Ultimate Web Performance & Scalability

Connectivity, responsiveness, and the ability to scale are of the utmost
importance for modern web applications. To meet these demands we have
developed a new flexible high performance web server, called
http://undertow.io/[Undertow] , and it's an integral part of WildFly 8.
Undertow has the ability to scale to over a million connections, and
third party benchmarks have shown it besting the competition when it
comes to throughput.

==== Memory Diet

WildFly takes an aggressive approach to memory management. The base
runtime services were developed to minimize heap allocation. These
services use common cached indexed metadata over duplicate full parses,
which reduces heap and object churn. The use of modular class loading
prevents duplicate classes and loading more than the system
configuration requires. This not only reduces the base memory overhead
but also helps to minimize garbage collector pauses. Finally the
administration console is 100% stateless and purely client driven. It
starts instantly and requires zero memory on the server.

These optimizations combined enable WildFly to run with stock JVM
settings and also on small devices. It also leaves more headroom for
application data and supports higher scalability.

|
==== Slimable / Customizable Runtime

WildFly's architecture is based on pluggable subsystems that can be
added or removed as needed. This allows you to remove capabilities you
dont need, and also reduce the overall disk footprint and memory
overhead required by the server.

This is all controlled by configuration which is arranged into subsystem
blocks. To remove a subsystem you simply need to delete that simple
block of configuration. For example, if you decide you only want Servlet
support, you can delete every subsystem but the "undertow" subsystem.

==== Unified configuration & Management

Rather than sending you on a wild goose chase to change a setting in the
application server, configuration in WildFly is centralized, simple and
user-focused. The configuration file is organized by subsystems that you
can easily comprehend and no internal server wiring is exposed.
Subsystems use intelligent defaults, but can still be customized to best
fit your needs. If you are running in domain mode, the configuration for
all servers participating in the domain is specified in a well-organized
manner within the same file.

Configuration changes aren't limited to file edits. All management
capabilities are exposed in a unified manner across many forms of
access. These include a CLI, a web based administration console, a
native Java API, an HTTP/JSON based REST API, and a JMX gateway. These
options allow for custom automation using the tools and languages that
best fit your needs.

[[domain-standalone-management]]
==== Domain & Standalone Management

WildFly offers two modes: a traditional, single JVM, standalone mode,
and a multi-JVM option, domain mode, which synchronizes configuration
across any number of processes and hosts.

All of the management capabilities previously described are available in
both modes. However domain mode adds a central control point, the domain
controller, for all of your systems.

Unlike solutions from other products, domain mode was designed to
consume minimal resources, and in the case of failure to not impact
running applications. Also, if you have a large domain, you can directly
query each individual host for runtime metrics, which prevents the
domain controller from becoming a bottleneck.

=== image:wildfly-icons-compliant_45px.png[] Supports Latest Standards and Technology

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
==== Java EE 7

WildFly implements the latest in enterprise Java standards. Java EE7
improves developer productivity by providing rich enterprise capabilities
in easy to consume frameworks that eliminate boiler plate and reduce
technical burden. This allows your team to focus on the core business
needs of your application.

In addition the frameworks that compose Java EE are heavily tested in
combination. Using these standards means you no longer have to worry
about finding the magic combination of various frameworks (and versions)
that happen to work together.

Finally, building your application on standards allows you the
flexibility to migrate between various vendor solutions. If you have
applications using these standards on another, perhaps proprietary
server, migrating to WildFly could breathe some fresh air into those
applications.

[[modern-web]]
==== Modern Web

WildFly supports the latest standards for web development. Web Socket
support allows your applications the ability to use optimized custom
protocols and full-duplex communication with your backend
infrastructure. This is particular useful in communicating with mobile
devices.

As web applications have evolved to become more client oriented with
rich dynamic JavaScript, data access over the web has become critical.
WildFly supports the latest standards for REST based data access,
including JAX-RS 2, and JSON-P.

The connectivity and responsiveness needs of modern web applications are
greater than ever. While WildFly will optimize traditional blocking I/O
applications, it also provides asynchrous and non-blocking APIs that
allow you to maximize the performance of critical resources in your
application.

Lastly, fault tolerance, clustering, session replication, and efficient
web proxying are all baked into WildFly as base level features.

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
==== No more jar hell!

Hierarchical classloaders are problematic, often causing failed
deployments and quirky behavior. The time has come to say goodbye to the
parent delegation model and find the path to modularity (i.e. sane
classloading).

WildFly does classloading right. It uses JBoss Modules to provide true
application isolation, hiding server implementation classes from the
application and only linking with JARs your application needs. Modules,
packaged as collections of classes, are peers that remain isolated
unless explicitly defined as a dependency of another module. Visibility
rules have sensible defaults, yet can be customized.

|
==== Fast Linking & Concurrent Loading

The dependency resolution algorithm in JBoss Modules is O(1), which
means that classloading performance is not affected by the number of
versions of libraries you have installed.

Classes are loaded concurrently, allowing for quick class discovery and
loading, even on large deployments.

=== image:wildfly-icons-testable_45px.png[Testable] Easily Testable

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
==== Arquillian

From the very start, WildFly has been designed with testability in mind.
The secret to that fidelity is http://www.arquillian.org/[Arquillian] ,
a component model for integration tests that execute inside the real
runtime environment.

By removing the clutter from your tests and handling deployment and test
execution, Arquillian enables you to write tests for just about any use
case your application encounters: real tests.

Thanks to the speed of WildFly, Arquillian tests run nearly as fast as
unit tests.

|
==== Smarter Development

The quick boot of WildFly combined with the easy-to-use Arquillian
framework allows for test driven development using the real environment
your code will be running in. You no longer need to pollute your
application object model with mock classes and test code. Your test code
is separate and simply deployed along side your application where it has
full access to server resources.
