== Why should I join?

WildFly is not only 100% open source, it is also developed for and by
its community of users. Developers join from all over the world, and
they contribute in many different ways. We are grateful for all
contributions, whether it be a new feature, a bug fix, wiki entries,
helping other members, or even just filing a bug report. The
relationship is symbiotic, every contribution you make encourages others
to in turn contribute in ways that will likely benefit you. The
experience is also rewarding. Let's look at why.

==== icon:rocket[] Build Awesome New Technology

You get to work on the latest and greatest technology. It's extremely
exciting working on what defines the future of application development.
It's always changing and never boring.

==== icon:book[] Learn Something New

WildFly is a big project covering many areas. You are bound to learn
something new with every contribution you make. Even our top
contributors are learning something new everyday, and they love it.


==== icon:certificate[] Prove Yourself

Experience contributing to WildFly looks fantastic on a resume, and on a
contracting reference list. It demonstrates talent and personal
commitment beyond a normal job.

== How do I get started?

Getting involved is easier than you think. All resources that you need
are available on the internet.


==== icon:wrench[] Build It

The first step to get started is to build WildFly yourself. This
requires creating a http://github.com[GitHub] account, forking WildFly,
and cloning your private fork. The
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HackingOnWildFly["Hacking On WildFly"]
wiki article contains complete instructions for this and the patch
construction and submission process.

==== icon:search[] Find Something To Work On

After you are comfortable building the server, the next step is to find
something that you would like to work on. Scan through our
http://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY[issue tracking system] and look for
an issue you would like to fix. For the WildFly Core subproject, we use
a http://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFCORE[separate project in the issue
tracker] , so it's a good idea to check there as well. We also stick
features that have not been scheduled / assigned into a special version
called
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY/fixforversion/12321689[Awaiting
Volunteers.] It is usually best to start with something small though
like a minor priority bug. If you need help locating a task, feature, or
bug to work on, just https://www.hipchat.com/gW90m6pIs[join our HipChat
channel] and ask for help. When you do locate an issue be sure to
announce your intention in the JIRA so that others don't end up
duplicating your effort.

==== icon:envelope[] Subscribe to our Mailing List

If you are intending to contribute, it's a good idea to
https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/wildfly-dev[join the
development mailing list.] All design and general development
discussions take place on this list. We also will send out important
notifications, like release schedule updates and system availability.

==== icon:github[] Submit A Pull Request

Follow the directions in the above linked wiki article on how to submit
the pull request. Once your pull request is submitted our automated CI
environment will test it, and report any test failures. You will get
email notifications in case this happens. A reviewer will also perform a
human review, and request additional changes or clarification if
required.

==== icon:bullhorn[] Brag

After your patch is successfully merged, it's time to celebrate!

==== icon:trophy[] Challenge Yourself

Working on server runtimes and development frameworks is no slice of
pie. But what fun is the easy level? While it can be challenging,
solving tricky problems leaves you feeling a real sense of
accomplishment.


==== icon:group[] Build Relationships

When contributing you get to work with some amazing people, and forging
relationships with other sharp minds is always great professionally and
personally.

==== icon:globe[] Be a Part of Something Big

Your contribution will be forever archived on the internet, and will
benefit many others. They will tackle a hard problem using your work,
they will learn by reading your work, and they will likely return the
favor.
