== User Forums

WildFly's user forums should be your first port of call for any
user-related issues with WildFly. Be it a question, wanting to report a
bug, looking for advice, or simply sharing some cool stories you may
have.

***********************************************************************
If you are asking for help, have you read through the
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY/Documentation[documentation]
first? You may find your answer there.

Also, if you are reporting a bug, have you checked our
http://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY[bug tracker] first? It may be a
known issue.

== Developers Mailing List

This is a mailing list geared towards developing WildFly itself. It
often contains deep, technical discussions on how WildFly works
internally, how new features could be implemented, and is definitely not
the place for end user questions such as how to configure, use or even
troubleshoot WildFly. Please use the User Forums for such questions.

If, however, you are helping contribute to WildFly, we welcome your
thoughts, ideas and overall participation on the developers' mailing list.
